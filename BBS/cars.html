					<h2>BBS Cars</h2>
					<h3>Vehicle Leasing</h3>
					<p>Sedan | 4X4 | Vans | Buses | Specialist Vehicles | Motorcycles |</p>
					<p>Would you like us to take on the burden of funding a new vehicle
					and its regular servicing?</p>
					<p>Select from our various models and vehicle types in our extensive fleet
					for your corporate and personal use.</p>
					<p>Leasing a new car should be a quick, simple and enjoyable experience
					and that is what BBS Logistics are here to provide for you.
					Consider our various options to suit your peculiar need.</p>

					<h3>Leasing, Contract Hire or Lease Purchase?</h3>
					<p>Choice is a wonderful thing and at BBS Logistics, you can not only select
						from any current make or model of car available, you can also build a
						finance package that's completely tailored to you. We provide vehicle
						leasing, vehicle lease purchase and vehicle contract hire finance options
						...but what does each option actually involve and what's the best choice
						for you?</p>

					<h3>Leasing</h3>
					<p>Flexibility is king when it comes to car leasing. You can drive away with a new vehicle with an initial deposit and a monthly payment that works best for you. What happens at the end of the lease though? You can give the car back to us, purchase it or continue to lease it - the choice is yours.</p>

					<h3>Lease Purchase</h3>

					<p>When it comes to vehicle lease purchase the clues in the name! You lease the car for a low-cost monthly payment now and still own your car at the end of the agreement. Car lease purchase offers unrivalled flexibility; there are no mileage restrictions on the vehicle and you can even reduce your monthly outgoings by agreeing to a purchase at the start of
					the lease. If it's flexibility you're after, then vehicle lease purchase is a great option.

					<h3>Contract Hire</h3>

					<p>This works best for those who need vehicles to run their day-to-day business activities with minimal stress. Think of Vehicle Contract Hire as something akin to a great value package holiday. We don't just give you the vehicle, you can bundle together a number of services such as maintenance, roadside assistance, vehicle servicing and much more. The best thing is, we package everything into a fixed monthly payment that suits you or your business.</p>

					<h3>Driver Outsourcing</h3>

					<p>Are you looking at overcoming the problems of indiscipline and lack of driving skill in your company's fleet?
					We have well-trained drivers with continuous professional development and a fleet management scheme to provide safe and diligent driving for your company.<br>
					We provide trained drivers for:</p>
					<ul>
    					<li>Bullion Van Services</li>
    					<li>Executive Cooperate Fleet</li>
    					<li>Standard Corporate Fleet</li>
    					<li>Dispatch Services</li>
    				</ul>
